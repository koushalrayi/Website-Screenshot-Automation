R code to capture full web page screenshots for multiple websites at once

# For Competitor Webpages
In secondary research, tracking competitor websites on a regular basis to report any new product or service additions or modifications is a routine. The process involves manually capturing screenshots or using free online tools that can capture only one URL at a time and this exercise usually eats up a lot of productive hours in a work day. If your intent is to capture those screenshots and create a repository, which would be used at a later time, then you may find the ‘webshot’ package in ‘R’ a real savior of your time. It quietly runs in the background, generating full webpage screenshots in PDF or PNG formats for multiple URLs at once.
